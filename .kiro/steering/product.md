# Memorial Tree

Memorial Tree is a Python package for modeling human thought processes and decision-making using tree data structures. The package aims to provide tools for computational psychiatry research by representing both conscious choices and unconscious influences (ghost nodes) in human cognitive processes.

## Core Features

- Tree-based modeling of human thought processes and decision-making
- Support for "ghost nodes" representing unconscious influences on decision-making
- Multiple backend support (NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow) for integration with existing ML workflows
- Specialized models for mental health conditions (ADHD, Depression, Anxiety)
- Visualization tools for analyzing thought patterns and decision paths

## Target Users

- Researchers in computational psychiatry and cognitive science
- Data scientists working on human behavior modeling
- Mental health professionals interested in computational approaches
- Python developers building cognitive modeling applications

## Project Goals

The primary goal is to provide a flexible, well-documented framework for modeling complex human thought processes that can contribute to computational psychiatry research and help develop better understanding of mental health conditions.
